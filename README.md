# Machine Learning Session

In this repository, I host the necessary files for working with machine learning in R. Specifically, it demonstrates how to use ML to predict tea cropland at the foot of Mount Kenya in Africa. Feel free to extend it.

## Tea Mapping in Kenya with Machine Learning

In this repository I host the necessary files for working with machine learning in R. Specifically, it demonstrates how to use ML to predict tea cropland at the foot of Mount Kenya in Africa. Feel free to extend it. It is part of a PhD workshop, [Satellite Data in Agricultural and Environmental Economics](https://www.agraroekonomik.de/M6900-Wuepper-Satellite%20Data%20in%20Agricultural%20and%20Environmental%20Economics.html).

Download the repository contents as a zip file, then extract it to a specific directory where you want to run it. The easier way is to clone the repository and create a version project.
